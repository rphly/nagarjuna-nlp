homag to the youth manjushri
homag to the great sage
who taught depend origin
the mean by which are elimin
aris and destruct
those whose mind ha transcend
exist and nonexist and abid no more in them
theyv realiz the mean of condit exist
the profound absenc of objectif
first nonexist the sourc of all fault
had alreadi been undon
now listen to the reason
that undo exist itself a well
if thing were truli exist
a imagin by the childish
what is the reason theyr not accept
a liber with no entiti of exist at all
one is not freed by exist
one doe not transcend samsara through nonexist
it through understand exist and nonexist
that the great be are liber
those who do not see ultim realiti
grasp at samsara and nirvana
but those who see ultim realiti poss
no pretent of world and it transcend
both samsara and nirvana
neither of these two exist
the thorough understand of cyclic exist
thi is refer to a nirvana
just a cessat is imput
on the disintegr of an arisen entiti
so too the sublim one accept
cessat that is illusionlik
thing ceas due to utter destruct
but not due to understand their condit natur
to whom will thi be evid
how can destruct be possibl
if grasp at aggreg do not ceas
even if afflict are extinct onel not transcend
howev when they come to ceas
at that instant one attain freedom
when the perfect gnosi see
that thing come from ignor a condit
noth will then be objectifi
either in term of aris or destruct
thi is transcend of sorrow
in thi veri life and one task is complet
if after the knowledg of truth
differenti occur here
and even with respect to most subtl thing
one imput origin
such an utterli unskil person doe not see
the mean of condit origin
if samsara come to an end
for a monk whose afflict are extinguish
whi have the perfectli awaken buddha
not explain that samsara ha begin
if there were a begin then certainli
there too would be cling in the form of dogma
that which is depend origin
how can there be it begin or end
that which ha arisen befor
how can it ceas again later on
devoid of the limit of begin and end
the world appear like an illus
when one view the aris of illus
or the dissolut of the illus
one who recogn illus is not confus
those who do not thoroughli crave
those who see with their mind
that exist is like a mirag and an illus
they will not be corrupt
by view grasp at begin and end
those who imput aris and disintegr
with relat to condit thing
they do not understand well the movement
of the wheel of depend origin
that which ha origin due to thi and that
that ha not done so a it own be
and that which ha not arisen a it own be
how can it be call arisen
the tranquil deriv from extinct of caus
thi is understood to be a cessat
that which is not extinguish through it intrins natur
how can that be call an extinguish
sinc there is noth that aris
there is noth that disintegr
yet the path of aris and disintegr
were taught by the buddha for a purpos
by understand aris disintegr is understood
by understand disintegr imperman is understood
by understand how to engag with imperman
the sublim dharma is understood a well
those who understand the depend origin
to be utterli devoid of aris and disintegr
those who have such knowledg will cross
the ocean of samsara of dogmat view
ordinari be who hold at entiti
who due to distort of exist and nonexist
are therefor under the domin of fault of afflict 
theyr be fool by their own mind
those whore learn with respect to the fact
they see that thing are imperman
decept mere shell empti and selfless
they see them a utterli isol
devoid of locu there is noth to objectifi
rootless they have no fix abod
they aris total from the caus of ignor
utterli devoid of begin middl and end
like a plantain tree they have no essenc
they resembl the citi of gandharva
thu thi dread world a citi of ignor
appear like a magic illus
brahma and so on that appear
so real to the be of thi world
theyr said to be fals to the nobl one
other than that what more is left
the world blind by ignor
follow after the current of desir
the wise whore excel are free of crave
how can these two be equal at all
to those search for ultim realiti
first one should say that everyth exist
later when they understand the mean
and are free of attach then teach the absenc
with no understand of the mean of absenc
but engag onli in mere studi
and fail to engag in meritori act
such base peopl are lost
the karma and their result
and the realm of rebirth are explain
full knowledg of their natur
and their absenc of origin are taught
just a the buddha have spoken of
i and mine for a practic purpos
likewis they spoke too of aggreg
element and sensefield for practic reason
such thing spoken of a the great element
these are fulli absorb into conscious
sinc they are dissolv by understand them
are they not fals imput
inasmuch a the conqueror have state
nirvana is the sole truth
what learn person would imagin
that the rest is not fals
a long a the mind remain waver
so long it remain within mara sphere
if thi is so then whi is it not reason
that thi depend origin is free of fault
sinc the buddha have state
that the world is condit by ignor
so whi is it not reason to assert
that thi world is a result of conceptu
sinc it come to an end
when ignor ceas
whi doe it not becom clear then
that it wa conjur by ignor
that which come into be from a caus
and doe not endur without condit
it disappear a well when condit are absent
how can thi be understood to exist
if the propon of exist
abid by cling to real entiti
there is noth to be surpris of
for they live by such a path
deplor are those who abid
by grasp at real entiti with content
while on the basi of the buddha path
they speak about imperman of all thing
if noth is observ
through examin of thi or that
what learn person would assert
that thi or that content is true
those who cling to a self
or to the world a uncondit
they are captiv by the view
about aris perman imperman and so on
those who assert the condit thing
a be establish in term of ultim realiti
whi wouldnt the fault of perman and so on
not aris within their mind
those who accept the condit thing
a be neither true nor fals
just like the moon in the water
they are not carri away by dogmat view
if one ha the thesi of real entiti
aw and viciou view aris
which give birth to attach and avers
from thi content ensu
thi is the caus of all dogmat view
without it no afflict will aris
so if thi is understood thoroughli
all view and afflict will ceas
who understand thi one might wonder
it those who see depend origin
the suprem knower of realiti ha taught
that depend aris is unborn
for those who are suppress by fals knowledg
and grasp the untru to be true
in them aris from attach
a seri of grasp and content
those who are great be
they have neither thesi nor content
for those who have no thesi
how can there be oppos thesi
have found a locu one is caught
by the twist snake of afflict
those whose mind have no locu
they will not be caught by thi snake
in those whose mind poss a locu
whi would the grave poison of afflict not aris
a for those who abid in between
they too will be caught by the snake of afflict
just a the child that think it to be real
feel attach to a reflect of form
likewis becaus the worldli be are ignor
they are trap in the cage of object
the great be see with their wisdom eye
all thing like reflect of form
they do not becom stuck
in the mire of socal object
the childish are attach to form
the moder attain detach
by know the natur of form
those of suprem intellect are free
one becom attach to someth
by think of it a pleasant
by turn away from it
one becom devoid of attach
the fault of mental afflict that torment
due to fals knowledg do not aris
to those who understand the mean
of conceptu of real and unreal entiti
if one poss a locu
one becom attach or detach
but the great be whore devoid of locu
they have neither attach nor detach
those who do not waver even with their fluctuat mind
in such term a thi is utterli absent
theyll cross the unbear ocean of samsara
agit by the monster of afflict
through thi virtu may all be
gather accumul of merit and wisdom
may they attain the two sublim buddha bodi
which aris from merit and wisdom
