Homage to the youthful Manjushri. How can “destruction” be possible? That which has arisen before, How can it cease again later on? That which has originated due to “this” and “that,” That has not done so as its own being; And that which has not arisen as its own being, How can it be called “arisen”? By understanding arising, disintegration is understood; By understanding disintegration, impermanence is understood; By understanding how to engage with impermanence, The sublime dharma is understood as well. The supreme knower of reality has taught That dependent arising is unborn. Those who are great beings, They have neither thesis nor contention; For those who have no thesis, How can there be opposing thesis? As for those who abide in between, They too will be caught by the snake of afflictions.
